dashboard for the department of motor vehicles of north carolina

Based on what you've described, here's my initial understanding of what we'd build:
DMV Operations Dashboard Overview
Core Modules:

Customer Flow Tracking - Real-time visitor counts, wait times, peak hours analysis
Appointment Management - Availability slots, no-show rates, scheduling efficiency
Staff Performance - Examiner productivity, service times, availability tracking
Customer Satisfaction - Survey responses, complaint tracking, satisfaction trends
Digital Services Analytics - Online renewals, digital adoption rates, service migration
Operational Insights - Branch comparisons, resource allocation recommendations

Key Features:

Real-time dashboards with live updates
Historical trend analysis and forecasting
Alert system for operational issues
Mobile-responsive design for on-the-go management
Export capabilities for reporting

The dashboard would help identify patterns like peak times, staffing needs, which services could be moved online, and where customer experience improvements are most needed.
